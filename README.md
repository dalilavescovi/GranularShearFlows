Problem:
We study the steady motion of a collection of N = 3000 identical spheres, sheared between two parallel bumpy planes, in the absence of gravity. The two bumpy boundaries move at constant relative velocity in the direction tangent to the planes themselves. The planes are made bumpy by gluing Nw = 240 spheres in a regular hexagonal fashion, at close contact and aligned with the direction of the flow. The spheres glued at the walls have the same diameter (d=1) and mechanical properties of the moving spheres. We take x and z to be the flow and shearing directions, respectively, and neglect variations in the transversal direction y. We focus on constant-volume conditions, so that the number of particles and the vertical distance between the walls, H, are kept constant during shearing. Periodic boundary conditions are employed in the x- and y-directions.
